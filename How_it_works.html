        The system that elects the United States president is called the electoral college. This system was created over two centuries ago in 1789 when the Constitution was created. In article II, section I of this document, it outlines the manner in which the president and vice president will be elected. A basic outline of the complex system can be found in the thrid clause of this section, where is says, (This clause of the Constitution was added in the <a href="History.html#12th Amendment">12th Amendment</a>)</p>
<div class="quote">
  “The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President.” (Find the rest of the article <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-ii">here</a>)

There are many important things mentioned in the section above, but fully understanding the electoral process requires breaking down each part.
</p>
<div class="center">
  <h2 id="Numbers!">Numbers!</h2>
</div>

<p>
Each of the 50 states and D.C. (District of Columbia) has a certain number of electors. For the states, this number is the number of congress members from that state or the number of senators, which is always two, added to the number of representatives or congressional districts. This means larger states in population have more electoral votes than smaller states since they have more congressional districts. The lowest number of electors, of course, is three since every state has at least one house representative and exactly two senators. As of 2021, there are seven states with the minimum number of electoral votes (3). These states include Alaska, Delaware, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Vermont. Even though D.C. isn’t a state, it still acts like one during the presidential election. The district is given 3 votes even though it doesn’t have any senators and a single non voting house representative.

</div>

<p>The electors from each state are the actual people who vote for the president and the vice president. Loosely speaking, the public “tells” these electors who to vote for. More specifically, the electors of each state vow to follow the popular vote of their state. This is known as a winner takes all system. This means that even if there are X votes for one candidate and X+1 votes for another, all the electors must vote for the candidate with X+1 votes, having the same outcome as if the split was 0 to 2X+1.</p>

Notice how the blue figure (democrat) only had one more vote than that of the red figure (republican) and still won the entire state.</figcaption>

  <h2 id="Two Special States (A District System)">Two Special States (A District System)</h2>
</div>

<p>Two of the states in the US have special system in which the entire state doesn’t have a winner take all system. The two states are Maine and Nebraska. There system incorporates the congressional districts into the decision. Two of the electors from the state vote for the entire states popular vote, and the other electors vote for the winner of their respective congressional district. Nebraska has three congressional districts while Main only has two. Still, however, it is rare for Nebraska and Maine to be split within the state. This has happened in Nebraska in 2008 when John McCaine won two of the congressional districts and Barack Obama won the other. Similarly, in Maine during the presidential election in 2016, Donald Trump won only one of the congressional districts while Hilary Clinton won the other. Finally, in the most recent election of 2020, Joe Biden won the popular vote and one of the two congressoinal districts in Maine (Donald Trump one the last), and Donald Trump won the popular vote as well as two of the three congresional district (Joe Biden won the other).</p>

  <h2 id="A Special Rule">A Special Rule</h2>
</div>



<p>One of the special rules mentioned in the <a href="/History.html#12th Amendment">12th Amendment</a> further establishing the system was that no elector may cast a ballot for both a president and vice president from the state that they represent. This is phrased in the Constitution as,
</p>
<div class="quote">
  “of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves.”
</div>
<p>
   This is saying that at least one
of the people that an elector votes for must be from a different state. Stated differently, an elector can’t vote for both a president and vice president from their state. This rule was put in place so as to not allow a single state to gain too much control and power.</p>

<div class="center">
  <h2 id="Faithless Electors">Faithless Electors</h2>
</div>

<p>Though the electors' responsibility is to represent the state they come from, they don’t always vote in accordance. In fact, there is no federal rule stating that electors must vote in this way, this ruling is passed down to the states. Thirty-three states and DC bind their electors to the popular vote (Or there district for Nebraska and Maine). However, the other seventeen states don’t have any law regarding the electors' ballots. For the former group of states, an elector who doesn’t follow their state, called a faithless elector, is charged for a misdemeanor with a relatively small fine of about $1,000. Though this seems like a concern that could cause a major problem in elections, faithless electors are quite rare. Considering that there are 538 total electoral votes, these votes don’t matter in the realm of switching the outcome. In each of the following elections, there has been one faithless elector: 1948, 1956, 1960, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1988. In 2000, there was a single blank ballot and in 2016, there were 7 for the presidential election and 6 for the vice presidential election. </p>
<div class="center">
  <h2 id="The Specific Process">The Specific Process</h2>
</div>

<p>The general system of the electoral college has been in place for a long time, but the specific way in which it is carried out has evolved. The current procedure that is done every four years was first established in the mid 1900s. After the polls close and each individual vote has been counted, the electors meet at the state's capital and cast their ballot based on the tallied votes from the state. On January 6 at 1:00 pm, the house and senate meet for a joint session. The sitting (current) vice president (Not the one that might be) opens an envelope from each state in alphabetical order, starting with Alabama and ending with Vermont. Each time, the vice president hands the results on paper to one of four tellers, two from the senate and two from the house. After a confirmation that the votes are real by saying, “The certificate of the electoral vote from the state of ____ seems to be regular in form and authentic.” The teller would then proceed by saying the amount of votes for the presidential and vice president elections. After the vice president has gone through all fifty states, the votes will be tallied and he will announce the new president and vice president, which could be themselves. There are, however, ways to object votes from a state.

<div class="center">
  <h2 id="Objections">Objections</h2>
</div>

<p>Before moving to the next state, the vice president will ask if anybody has any objections to that state's electoral votes. Lawmakers may object to individual votes or the entire state's votes. Objectionas must be in writing and signed by a house representative and senator and the vice president will ask for this upon the initial objection. If it has been written and signed, the session will recess for under two hours and each chamber (The House and the Senate) will separate to discuss. Each member is only permitted to speak for under five minutes. After discussing, both chambers vote separately and the joint session reconvenes. If both the House and the Senate voted in favor of the objection, then it is approved. If one or neither of the chambers approve it, the objection isn’t approved. If the objection is approved, the votes from that state don’t get counted and the vice president proceeds to the next state. Like faithless electors, objections are quite rare, and they have been raised with the appropriate signatures in 1969, 2005, and 2021 (The year right after an election), but none of them were approved and the votes were still counted.
