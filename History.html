      <p>As stated in the <a href="How_it_works.html">How it works</a> section, the electoral college was first established in the constitution. Surprisingly, the now well known term “Electoral College” never appeared in the original constitution or in the 12th amendment. The term only became popular in the early 1800s.  The founding fathers thought that the system was a good balance from the congress solely electing the president and a popular vote. When deciding on a system, the founding fathers went through many possible systems that could be used, but eventually settled on the electoral college system because it made it so the large states couldn’t completely dominate over smaller states. Because the system was included in the Constitution, it requires a constitutional amendment to be greatly modified.

        <h3>12th Amendment to the Consitution</h3>

      </div>

      <p>The biggest amendment that changed the way the president and vice president get selected was the 12th amendment. Congress approved it on October 19, 1803 and it was ratified by the states on June 15, 1884, meaning that the new amended system would first be used in the 1804 election. </p>


      <h3 id="Changing the Vice President election">Changing the Vice President election</h3>
      <p>Before the 12th amendment, the presidential election was much different. Each elector voted for two candidates and, once the votes were tallied, the person with the most votes would be president and the runner up would be vice president. At the start of the electoral college, political parties hadn’t formed yet, but expecting the president to cooperate with the person they had just run against was hard. This was because they often had very different views and ideas so cooperation was quite difficult. After the 12th amendment was passed, however, this issue was fixed. Each party nominates a president and vice president for the election meaning that the winning president and vice president are from the same party. Though this didn’t affect the electoral college, the 12th amendment also made it so that the vice president was required to have the same qualifications as the president. This was a direct result from changing how the vice president was selected.

      <h3 id="Different state rule">Different state rule</h3>
      <p>The 12th amendment also created the rule about electors voting for both a vice president and a president from the same state described <a href="/How_it_works.html#A Special Rule">here</a>. A historical example of this was in the 2000 election when George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were both registered to vote in Texas, so Cheney changed his voting registration to Wyoming where he previously lived. </p>

      <h3 id="Non Majority Vote">Non Majority Vote</h3>
      <p>The final thing that the 12 Amendment changed was how the winner would be elected if there was ever a non majority vote (270). This could happen if the candidates were completely tied with 269 electoral votes, or if a 3rd party candidate received electoral votes and nobody got 270. In this case, the decision would be up to congress. For the president, the house votes, one vote for each state, from the top three candidates which changed from the top five before the 12th amendment. For vice president, each of the 100 senators votes from the top two vice presidential candidates. Because each state is only allowed a single vote for president and two votes for vice president, big states have just as much representation as the smaller states. This means that it is more likely that the president or vice president won’t be who received the most votes from the electoral college, but rather another candidate than if each state was given a proportional amount of votes. This process of congress choosing the president and vice president has happened on three occasions. In 1800 and 1824, the house chose the president. In 1836, the senate chose the vice president.

       <p>As explained <a href="/How_it_works.html#Two Special States (A District System)">here</a>, Nebraska and Maine have a slightly different system for their electoral college. Nebraska introduced this in 1992 and Maine started it 20 years earlier in 1972.
